    We are Fotini, Lisa &amp; Sarah, the founders of Sister Street. The app has been inspired by our own and our friends&rsquo; experiences. At Sister Street, we&apos;re committed to empowering women and supporting them in claiming their rightful place as equal citizens. Our goal is to make women feel safer navigating and sharing urban spaces, and to prevent gender-based violence, making our cities more inclusive and secure.
  </p>
  <p>
    We&apos;ve been inspired by the UN Sustainable Goals 3, 5, 11, and 16, which encourage healthy living and well-being, gender equality, inclusive and sustainable cities, and peaceful and inclusive societies. We&apos;re not just looking for quick fixes â€“ we&apos;re dedicated to creating real, long-lasting social change. Our interdisciplinary team is working closely with local governments, law enforcement, and other official bodies to improve women&apos;s safety, one step at a time.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe that by working together, we can make a real difference in the lives of women everywhere - starting from Greece.
